"""
Creates the HeartRateRange and SpeedRange features

HeartRateRange is between 0 and 1, where 0 is 0% of maximum heart rate, and 1 is 100%
HeartRateQuotient is the percentage of heart rates that are below the current value.

SpeedRange is between 0 and 1, where 0 is 0% of maximum heart rate, and 1 is 100%
SpeedQuotient is the percentage of heart rates that are below the current value.
